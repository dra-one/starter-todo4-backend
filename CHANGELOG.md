### Job 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 Completed
### We ran into too many problems with setting PHP in Harshita's computer.
### To speed up our work, we decided that it's just faster and better to work
### together since my computer somehow started working properly. Today we
### focused on figuring out the confusion in the TaskTest Class. After lots
### of struggle, we made it work from the root project folder using the command:
### $ vendor/bin/phpunit

## [2.0.0] - 2017-11-05
### Job 8 Completed
### It was a frustration many hours of work trying to set up
### the code report. However, composer already had xdebug ready
### to run so the only thing we were missing was adding the 
### loggging xml tab in the phpunit.xml.dist file.
